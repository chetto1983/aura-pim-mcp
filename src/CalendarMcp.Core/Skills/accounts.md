# Accounts

Every tool in Adjutant operates against one or more configured
accounts. Understanding the account model is prerequisite to anything
else you do here.

## Discover accounts first

Call **`list_accounts`** at the start of any new session. It returns:

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "accountId": "work-m365",
      "provider": "microsoft365",
      "displayName": "Work (M365)",
      "domains": ["lhotka.net"],
      "capabilities": [
        { "name": "calendar", "readOnly": false },
        { "name": "email",    "readOnly": false },
        { "name": "contacts", "readOnly": false }
      ]
    },
    {
      "accountId": "family-cal",
      "provider": "ics",
      "displayName": "Family Calendar",
      "domains": [],
      "capabilities": [
        { "name": "calendar", "readOnly": true }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Use these fields to decide what's possible before calling other tools:

- **`accountId`** — the only identifier other tools accept. Pass it
  verbatim; don't reformat or guess.
- **`provider`** — informs behavior (Gmail uses labels, M365 uses folders,
  ICS is read-only, etc.). See `providers` for details.
- **`domains`** — the email domains this account "owns." Used by
  smart-routing in `send_email`.
- **`capabilities`** — which categories the account supports and whether
  they are read-only. Always check this before calling a write tool.

## Provider type values

The `provider` field returned by `list_accounts` uses these canonical
strings:

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `microsoft365` | Microsoft 365 / Entra ID (Graph) |
| `google` | Google Workspace / Gmail |
| `outlook.com` | Consumer Outlook.com / Hotmail (Graph) |
| `imap` | IMAP + SMTP (unattended mailboxes) |
| `ics` | Subscribed iCalendar URL (calendar only, read-only) |
| `json` | JSON file (read-only; calendar + optional email/contacts) |

## Always pass `accountId` explicitly

Most tools accept `accountId` as optional. When you omit it, the server
either targets the first configured account or uses smart routing — both
can silently target the wrong account. Treat the `accountId` parameter as
effectively required for any tool that writes data
(`send_email`, `create_event`, `create_contact`, `delete_email`, etc.).

The exceptions where omitting `accountId` is fine:

- `get_emails`, `search_emails`, `list_calendars`, `get_calendar_events`,
  `get_contacts`, `search_contacts` — these fan out across all enabled
  accounts when `accountId` is omitted, which is often what you want.
- `get_contextual_email_summary` — always fans out across all accounts.

The calendar fan-outs (`list_calendars`, `get_calendar_events`)
automatically skip accounts that lack a `calendar` capability (e.g.
email-only IMAP accounts), so those never produce errors or warnings.
Targeting such an account explicitly via `accountId` returns no events
plus an actionable warning.

## Capability checking before write operations

Before calling a write tool (e.g. `create_event`), confirm the chosen
account isn't read-only for that category:

```text
capability = account.capabilities.find(c => c.name === "calendar")
if !capability || capability.readOnly == true:
  pick a different account (or surface an error to the user)
```

This avoids calling `create_event` against an `ics` or `json` account,
which will fail at the provider layer with a less helpful message.

## Smart routing in `send_email`

`send_email` accepts a missing `accountId`. When omitted:

1. Extract domain from the first recipient (`to[0]` after `@`).
2. Look up accounts whose `domains` array contains that domain.
3. If exactly one matches, send from it.
4. If multiple match, the first one is used (deterministic but arbitrary).
5. If none match, the first configured account is used as fallback.

This is convenient for casual replies but **unsafe for production
workflows** — always pass `accountId` when correctness matters (e.g.
sending from a specific persona, replying within the same account that
received the original).

## Multi-account fan-out

`get_emails`, `search_emails`, and `get_contextual_email_summary` query
all accounts in parallel and merge results, sorting newest-first. Each
returned email carries its own `accountId` — use that to call
`get_email_details`, `move_email`, etc. Never assume the original
`accountId` you might have used for filtering; always echo it back from
the result.

## Disabled accounts

Accounts can be marked disabled via the admin UI. `list_accounts`
returns only enabled accounts. If a previously-known `accountId` stops
working, re-call `list_accounts` to refresh.
