            Please triage my inbox. Follow these steps:

            1. Call list_accounts to discover all configured accounts.
            2. Call get_emails with unreadOnly=true for each account (or omit accountId to query all at once).
            3. For messages that look important, call get_email_details to read the full body.

            {focusHint}

            Present results as a prioritised triage:

            ## Requires Action
            List emails that need a reply or action today, with sender, subject, and a one-line summary of what's needed.

            ## FYI / Low Priority
            List emails that are informational but don't need a reply.

            ## Can Probably Ignore
            List newsletters, notifications, or bulk mail that can be archived or deleted.

            After presenting the triage, ask which emails I'd like to act on.

            Please forward an email with its attachments. Follow these steps in order — the attachment flow is non-obvious, so do not skip steps:

            1. Call get_email_details with emailId="{{emailId}}" and accountId="{{accountId}}".
               - Capture the subject, body, and attachments[] array.
               - Each attachment carries a provider-side attachmentId — this is NOT the ID you pass to send_email.

            2. For each attachment in the response:
               Call get_email_attachment with accountId="{{accountId}}", emailId="{{emailId}}", attachmentId=<provider-side ID>.
               - This returns a server-stash attachmentId (different namespace from the provider's).
               - Stash IDs are single-use; they're consumed by the send below.

            3. Call send_email:
               - accountId="{{accountId}}" (forward from the same account that received the original)
               - to=[<each address in "{{forwardTo}}">]
               - subject="Fwd: <original subject>"
               - body=<noteLine> + "\n\n---\n\n" + original body
               - attachments=[{ "attachmentId": <stash-id-1> }, { "attachmentId": <stash-id-2> }, ...]

            Note to include: {{noteLine}}

            4. Confirm the forward was sent and report how many attachments were included.

            If any attachment exceeds provider limits (3 MB on M365/Outlook.com, 25 MB on Google), surface the error to the user — don't retry blindly.

            Please help me unsubscribe from marketing emails. Follow these steps:

            1. Call search_emails with query="{query}", count=50{(accountId != null ? $", accountId=\"{accountId}\"" : "")}. {accountHint}

            2. Present the candidate list to me (sender, subject, account) and ask which to skip, if any. Do not proceed silently — bulk unsubscribe is hard to reverse.

            3. For each remaining candidate:
               a. Call get_unsubscribe_info with its accountId and emailId to confirm a List-Unsubscribe method exists.
               b. If a method is available, call unsubscribe_from_email with method="auto" — this prefers one-click POST, then falls back to HTTPS URL, then mailto.
               c. If no method is available, skip that message and note it in the summary.

            4. Report back:
               - How many we tried to unsubscribe from.
               - How many succeeded (one-click vs URL returned vs mailto sent).
               - How many had no unsubscribe method.
